# 2D_Fourier_Phase_Swap
A simple script that uses NumPy and Matplotlib to read in two images and swap their phases.

This experiment demonstrates the impotance of phase for reconstructing images with appropriate structural features.

Included is the .py script, and a jupyter notebook for clarity.

Enjoy,

Tristan
